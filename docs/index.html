        	<h4 class="content-title">About</h4>
        	<div class="content"><p>Hello!</p>

<p>If you landed on this page, thank you for stopping by to learn more about me.</p>

<p>I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived primarily in the Southeast, with the exception of four years in Germany, where I worked as a civilian for the Department of the Army in Newspaper, Public Affairs, and Social Services. I then spent two years in Saudi Arabia where I worked as a program analyst for a joint military services operation. I relocated to the San Antonio area late May 2016.</p>

<p>In addition to government service, my career path includes 15 years at one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical and healthcare companies. The first few years I worked in marketing support for the pharmaceutical business before moving into a communications role in procurement. During the last 12 years, I was responsible for HR Communications and the branding and upscaling of Inclusion and Diversity from a US concept to a global strategic initiative.</p>

<p>In 2011, I resigned from my corporate role to follow my dream of writing and publishing books. In the last seven years, I’ve written seven books, published six, contributed to seven best-selling anthologies, spoken at events both big and small, and coached hundreds of men and women to fearlessly chase their dreams — just like I did! One of my most successful coaching clients is now a published author himself.</p>

<p>I’m glad I took time away from my original career path to focus on my creative aspirations. Now that I’ve got <em>that</em> out of my system, I’m itching to jump back into the hustle and bustle of the business world. I’ve missed working in a team environment. I’ve missed setting and exceeding goals. But most of all, I’ve missed contributing to something much bigger than myself.</p>

<p>Looking back, a consistent theme I heard from colleagues and managers is that I have the ability to achieve stellar results in short periods of time. In one performance review, an Air Force Colonel wrote that I was within the top five percent of all civilian action officers he had known in 25 years of service! That sentiment was echoed by a private sector manager who wrote in my performance review that I could do more in nine months than most people can do in a year or more. Bottom line: I get things done!</p>

<p>What drives me?</p>

<p>Big hairy audacious goals. Commradery. Hard work AND hard play. Learning. Growing. Asking lots of questions. Listening for the threads of similarity between seemingly different positions. Being the best that I can be. Inspiring the best in others.</p>

<p>My goal is to find a company whose vision and mission inspires me — a company I can believe in. It also means finding an environment where my skills will be not only be valued, but also <em>utilized</em>. I know I bring a lot to the table and I’m hungry to make a difference.</p>

<p>When I find the company where I can make the most comprehensive use of my skills to move the organization forward, you can bet that’s where I’ll seek to land!</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Communications Strategy &amp; Execution (US/Global/Internal/External)</strong></p>

<p>Short and long-term communications strategies and tactics, incorporating all available and appropriate tools and resources, engages communities and key influencers while increasing Company reputation. My experience includes strategic marketing plans, media/public relations, advertising, internal/external communications, publications (traditional and social media), crisis communications, events, and corporate identity and branding. <strong>Example of work:</strong> I developed and executed global communications on behalf of the CEO for a mandated Senior Leader Mentoring initiative to engage to top 1,200 leaders as mentors. I developed the resource-rich web portal and the global launch plan. Responsible for creating all CEO communications, including the scripting of a 20-minute training video delivered by the CEO via global broadcast across 80 countries.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Content Creation &amp; Management</strong></p>

<p>The right content at the right time and place increases employee loyalty and enhance the external brand reputation of the Company mission. <strong>Example of work:</strong> I developed content for the monthly Company magazine, various business-specific websites, the annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, local and national advertising campaigns, promotional videos, business cases, position papers, employee policies, video and event scripting, training curriculum development and delivery, speech writing, and external awards submissions. See the portfolio tab to see examples.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Research and Best-Practice Sharing</strong></p>

<p>To stay on the cutting edge of business, ongoing learning is a must. Research and best-practice sharing are great ways to measure how we stand up to other companies across industries. <strong>Example of work:</strong> As an advisor to senior leadership on best practices and strategic insight that enhanced employee loyalty and external reputation, I wrote a position paper and presentation advocating the importance of extending employee benefits to include reassignment surgery for employees undergoing transgender reassignment. My presentation to the Chief Medical Officer and Legal resulted in them carrying it forward for to the CEO and Corporate Executive Team for review and approval.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Event Planning &amp; Execution, Speaking, Emceeing, &amp; Interviewing</strong></p>

<p>Events can create business momentum, help capitalize on opportunities, and enhance reputation. Planning and executing events, whether virtual or on location, requires vision as well as attention to the smallest detail. <strong>Example of work:</strong> Conceived, planned, and executed the first global awards program in company history to be hosted by the CEO and his 15 direct reports from around the world. Assembling a global team of more than 60 people, I scripted, produced, directed, and emceed the program for 200 employees in attendance a full 90 days earlier than planned in order to accommodate executive schedules. 100% of survey respondents from attendees agreed or strongly agreed that the event made them proud to be an employee. 92% agreed or strongly agreed that the event increased their awareness and understanding of the impact that inclusive marketing and diversity practices had on the business. See a <a href="https://www.sheilacallaham.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MMDA_AWARDS_DISC-1.mov"><strong>short clip of me</strong></a> speaking during this event (introduction by George Quesnelle, President, GSK Consumer Healthcare).</p>
