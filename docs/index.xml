      <description>Hello!
If you landed on this page, thank you for stopping by to learn more about me.
I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived primarily in the Southeast, with the exception of four years in Germany, where I worked as a civilian for the Department of the Army in Newspaper, Public Affairs, and Social Services. I then spent two years in Saudi Arabia where I worked as a program analyst for a joint military services operation.</description>
