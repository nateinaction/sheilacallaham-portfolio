**Communications Strategy & Execution (US/Global/Internal/External)**

Short and long-term communications strategies and tactics, incorporating all available and appropriate tools and resources, engages communities and key influencers while increasing Company reputation. My experience includes strategic marketing plans, media/public relations, advertising, internal/external communications, publications (traditional and social media), crisis communications, events, and corporate identity and branding. **Example of work:** I developed and executed global communications on behalf of the CEO for a mandated Senior Leader Mentoring initiative to engage to top 1,200 leaders as mentors. I developed the resource-rich web portal and the global launch plan. Responsible for creating all CEO communications, including the scripting of a 20-minute training video delivered by the CEO via global broadcast across 80 countries.

**Content Creation & Management**

The right content at the right time and place increases employee loyalty and enhance the external brand reputation of the Company mission. **Example of work:** I developed content for the monthly Company magazine, various business-specific websites, the annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, local and national advertising campaigns, promotional videos, business cases, position papers, employee policies, video and event scripting, training curriculum development and delivery, speech writing, and external awards submissions.

**Research and Best-Practice Sharing**

To stay on the cutting edge of business, ongoing learning is a must. Research and best-practice sharing are great ways to measure how we stand up to other companies across industries. **Example of work:** As an advisor to senior leadership on best practices and strategic insight that enhanced employee loyalty and external reputation, I wrote a position paper and presentation advocating the importance of extending employee benefits to include reassignment surgery for employees undergoing transgender reassignment. My presentation to the Chief Medical Officer and Legal resulted in them carrying it forward for to the CEO and Corporate Executive Team for review and approval.

**Event Planning & Execution, Speaking, Emceeing, & Interviewing**

Events can create business momentum, help capitalize on opportunities, and enhance reputation. Planning and executing events, whether virtual or on location, requires vision as well as attention to the smallest detail. **Example of work:** Conceived, planned, and executed the first global awards program in company history to be hosted by the CEO and his 15 direct reports from around the world. Assembling a global team of more than 60 people, I scripted, produced, directed, and emceed the program for 200 employees in attendance a full 90 days earlier than planned in order to accommodate executive schedules. 100% of survey respondents from attendees agreed or strongly agreed that the event made them proud to be an employee. 92% agreed or strongly agreed that the event increased their awareness and understanding of the impact that inclusive marketing and diversity practices had on the business. See a [**short clip of me**](https://www.sheilacallaham.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MMDA_AWARDS_DISC-1.mov) speaking during this event (introduction by George Quesnelle, President, GSK Consumer Healthcare).
